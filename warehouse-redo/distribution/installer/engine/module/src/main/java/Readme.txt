Packages com.mysql.* and org.gjt.* contain source files of the JDBC 3 driver (with small changes).
Installer uses this driver for executing SQL queries on the step of database creation (DBConfigPanel.java).

I know that this variant is not good, but I haven't found another )
For more information contact with me.
