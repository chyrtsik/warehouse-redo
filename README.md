Terms of use: feel free to use it for personal and education purposes. To use of the software in any commercial product or service please email tchirtik@gmail.com to agree on terms. 

Disclaimer: this software is LAN-friendly only due to the overuse of the "fat client" approach in the code. It is still usable in a remote mode (via wifi, vpn, ssh tunnels, but 
it is slow if you network has >1ms ping time to the Mysql server).
